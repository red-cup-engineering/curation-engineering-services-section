# schedule-set-of-votes
## Requirements
- `pure-transformation`: The operation performs no I/O (no network call, no file read, no clock beyond the injectable `request.now`); every input it needs (the yield readout, the account's mana, the vote policy, the candidate posts) arrives as plain data.
- `reads-account-mana-from-readout`: The operation reads `request.yieldReadout.accounts[request.account].votingManabar` (`maxManaRaw`, `currentManaRaw`, both raw integer strings) as the account's available voting-mana budget base; it refuses (throws `TypeError`) when `request.account` is not a key of `request.yieldReadout.accounts`.
- `applies-vote-policy`: The operation applies `request.policy` (defaults documented in its JSDoc): `dailyManaBudgetPercent` (percent of the account's current mana spendable today), `minWeight`/`maxWeight` (Hive vote-weight bounds, out of {{max-vote-weight}}), a dust rule (`dustPendingPayoutThresholdHbd`, `dustWeight`) for short-form/low-payout content per `task:dust-curation-micro-blogging`, `preferredTags` (tags whose posts get `maxWeight` instead of `minWeight` when not dust), `neverVoteAuthors`, and a curation window (`curationWindowSeconds` default {{curation-window-seconds}} per `task:social-mev-predictive-curation`'s reverse-auction theory, `curationWindowToleranceSeconds` default {{curation-window-tolerance-seconds}}).
- `schedules-within-window-and-budget`: For each of `request.candidatePosts` (`{tag,symbol,author,permlink,ageSeconds,pendingPayoutValueHbd,netRshares}`), the operation schedules a vote (post, weight, ISO `time`) only when the author is not excluded, `ageSeconds` falls inside the curation window (`curationWindowSeconds` +/- `curationWindowToleranceSeconds`), and the vote's estimated mana cost keeps cumulative spend at or under the daily mana budget; `time` is `request.now` plus however many seconds remain until `curationWindowSeconds` has elapsed since the post's creation (zero if already past it).
- `estimates-mana-cost`: The operation estimates one vote's mana cost as `maxManaRaw * weight / 500000` — the Hive design constant that a full-weight ({{max-vote-weight}}) vote costs one {{full-votes-per-regeneration}}th of max mana, since voting mana fully regenerates over {{regeneration-seconds}} seconds at the chain's reserve rate of {{reserve-rate}} full-power votes per day. [claims: mana-cost-divisor]
- `estimates-curation-return`: The operation reports `expectedCurationReturnHbd` per scheduled vote as an explicitly labeled order-of-magnitude estimate (the post's tag's `yieldHbdPerMillionRshares` from `request.yieldReadout.tags`, times the voter's own estimated rshares contribution scaled by `maxManaRaw` and `weight`) — never presented as the chain's exact curator-share formula.
- `reports-refusals`: The operation reports every refused candidate with exactly one reason: `author-excluded`, `outside-window`, or `mana-below-floor`.
- `exact-decimal-strings`: Every numeric quantity in the returned record is a decimal string or a plain integer, derived using `@red-cup-engineering/computer-ledger-system-services-section`'s BigInt-scaled decimal primitives (`parseDecimal`, `formatScaled`, `multiplyDecimalStrings`) plus this operation's own BigInt-scaled division helper — never a JavaScript float carried into a reported decimal.
## Prohibitions
- `no-second-decimal-arithmetic`: The operation must not re-implement decimal-string parsing, formatting, or multiplication that `@red-cup-engineering/computer-ledger-system-services-section`'s `decimal.mjs` already exports; it may add exactly one new BigInt-scaled decimal-division helper, because no house decimal-division-strings primitive exists yet (the same documented gap `observe-hive-internal-market` and `observe-tribe-curation-yield` already admit). [claims: decimal-arithmetic-has-one-owner, dep-computer-ledger-system-services-section]
- `no-network-or-clock`: The operation must never call `fetch`, read a file, or call `Date.now()`/`new Date()` with no argument for anything other than the CLI's own stdin-line loop; every timestamp used in scheduling logic comes from `request.now`. [claims: a-pure-operation-does-no-io]
- `no-signing-or-broadcast`: The operation must never sign, broadcast, or accept a private key; it produces a schedule for `cast-set-of-votes` to execute, never executes anything itself. [claims: a-pure-operation-does-no-io]
## Laws
- `primitives-exist-once` | 561 Group working discipline | 2026-08-30 | CLAUDE.md | Applies to all decimal arithmetic in this operation. | The BigInt-scaled decimal primitives live once, in `@red-cup-engineering/computer-ledger-system-services-section`; this operation composes them by exact pin.
- `fabricate-do-not-hand-write` | 561 Group working discipline, dispatch-agents skill | 2026-09-04 | .claude/skills/dispatch-agents/SKILL.md | Applies to this whole operation source file. | The operation is born through the jsnode fabrication line from this work order, never hand-written.
- `frictions-are-duties` | 561 Group working discipline | 2026-09-04 | .claude/rules/working-discipline.md | Applies to the one new decimal-division helper this operation adds. | No house decimal-division-strings primitive exists yet; this gap is admitted as a friction rather than silently grown into a second decimal library.
- `voting-is-not-fenced` | Operating constraint | 2026-09-04 | .claude/rules/working-discipline.md | Applies to why this operation and its siblings exist at all. | The standing fence is no automated POSTING or commenting from the existing Hive accounts; voting was never fenced, so scheduling and casting votes are in scope.
## Standards
- `node-esm-operation` | Node.js | v24.2.0+ | https://nodejs.org/docs/v24/api/esm.html | Applies to the .mjs operation and its import.meta.main guard. | The package uses one executable ESM operation source file eligible for downstream staged package-birth assays.
- `hive-voting-mana-regeneration-design` | Hive/Steem blockchain design (voting power model) | 2026 revision | https://developers.hive.io/apidefinitions/ | Applies to the `estimates-mana-cost` requirement's 1/50-per-100%-vote constant. | Voting mana regenerates fully over 5 days (432000 seconds) by protocol design, targeting 50 full-power (weight 10000) votes per day; a 100%-weight vote therefore costs 1/50 (2%) of max mana, and a partial-weight vote costs that fraction proportionally.
## Open questions
- `curation-return-estimate-precision` [nonblocking]: `expectedCurationReturnHbd` is an order-of-magnitude proxy (tag yield times an estimated own-rshares contribution), not the chain's exact curator-share reverse-auction formula; a follow-on task may replace it with a reward-fund-aware calculation once `reward_fund`/`recent_claims` reads are added.

- `decimal-arithmetic-has-one-owner` | derived | world | Decimal-string parsing, formatting and multiplication have one owner, published at the exact version this order pins | none | constraint:primitives-exist-once; claim:dep-computer-ledger-system-services-section | The law places the primitive once in its owner, and the pinned owner is on the registry, so composing it leaves nothing to reimplement and a second implementation is outside what the law permits
- `a-pure-operation-does-no-io` | derived | world | An operation that performs no I/O has no network call, file read or clock of its own to broadcast with | none | requirement:pure-transformation | The requirement admits no I/O beyond the injectable now, and signing or broadcasting is I/O
