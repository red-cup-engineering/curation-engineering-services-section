# observe-tribe-curation-yield
## Requirements
- `reads-tag-posts`: The operation reads `bridge.get_ranked_posts` (sort `created`, `limit` from `request.postsPerTag`, default {{posts-per-tag}}) for each entry of `request.tags` (a `{name,tag,symbol}` list; default LEO/`leofinance`, POB/`proofofbrain`, CENT/`cent`, WAIV/`waivio`, plus a `symbol:null` base-layer row `{name:"BASE",tag:"hive",symbol:null}`) from two public Hive condenser/bridge JSON-RPC nodes (`request.nodes`, default `["https://api.hive.blog","https://api.openhive.network"]`).
- `witnesses-two-nodes`: The operation also reads `condenser_api.get_dynamic_global_properties` from both nodes and returns a `witnesses` array naming each node and its `head_block_number`.
- `refuses-node-disagreement`: The operation refuses (throws, message prefixed `CURATION_YIELD_NODE_DISAGREEMENT`) when the two nodes' `head_block_number` values differ by more than `request.maxBlockGap` (default {{max-block-gap}}), when a tag's two nodes' summed `pending_payout_value` (HBD) differ by more than `request.toleranceBasisPoints` (default {{tolerance-basis-points}}, wider than a single order-book price because an aggregated multi-post sum is a noisier live signal) basis points, or when an account's two nodes' effective-vesting-shares or `voting_manabar.current_mana` differ by more than that same tolerance.
- `computes-tag-yield`: For each tag, the operation sums the primary node's returned posts' `pending_payout_value` (exact decimal) and `net_rshares` (exact integer), and reports `postCount`, `pendingPayoutSumHbd`, `netRshareSum`, and `yieldHbdPerMillionRshares` (the pending-payout sum per million net-rshares of accumulated vote weight — an inverse-competition curation-yield proxy, honestly documented as that and not the chain's own curator-share formula; `null` when `netRshareSum` is zero), plus `oldestPostAgeSeconds`/`newestPostAgeSeconds` computed against `request.now`.
- `reads-hive-engine-token-supply`: For each tag whose `symbol` is non-null, the operation reads Hive-Engine's `tokens` contract `tokens` table (`find`, query `{symbol}`) from `request.hiveEngineNode` (default `https://api.hive-engine.com/rpc/contracts`) and reports `circulatingSupply`, `totalStaked`, `precision` — single-witness (see Open questions), never cross-checked against a second Hive-Engine node.
- `reads-account-manabar`: For each of `request.accounts` (default `["emsenn0","michael561"]`), the operation reads `condenser_api.get_accounts` from both nodes, computes effective vesting shares (`vesting_shares + received_vesting_shares - delegated_vesting_shares`, in the same raw integer units as `voting_manabar.current_mana`), and projects current voting mana to `request.now` using the Hive manabar regeneration model (linear regen to `maxMana` over {{regeneration-seconds}} seconds, capped at `maxMana`), reporting `currentManaRaw`, `maxManaRaw`, `currentManaPercent`, `lastUpdateTime`. [claims: regeneration-seconds]
- `exact-decimal-strings`: Every numeric quantity in the returned record is a decimal string: chain-native strings passed through unchanged, or values derived using `@red-cup-engineering/computer-ledger-system-services-section`'s BigInt-scaled decimal primitives (`parseDecimal`, `formatScaled`, `addDecimalStrings`, `multiplyDecimalStrings`, `stripUnitSuffix`) plus this operation's own BigInt-scaled division helper — never a JavaScript float carried into the record.
- `read-only`: The operation calls only read (`condenser_api`/`bridge`/Hive-Engine `find`) JSON-RPC methods; it never broadcasts a transaction, never signs anything, and accepts no private key.
- `supports-deterministic-replay`: The operation accepts an optional `request.fixtures` (literal, JSON-serializable pre-recorded node/Hive-Engine results keyed as documented in its JSDoc) and `request.now`; when both are given for every read the request would otherwise make, the operation makes no network call at all and returns a fully deterministic record.
## Prohibitions
- `no-second-decimal-arithmetic`: The operation must not re-implement decimal-string parsing, formatting, addition, or multiplication that `@red-cup-engineering/computer-ledger-system-services-section`'s `decimal.mjs` already exports; it may add exactly one new BigInt-scaled decimal-division helper, because no house decimal-division-strings primitive exists yet (the same documented gap `observe-hive-internal-market` already admits). [claims: decimal-arithmetic-has-one-owner, dep-computer-ledger-system-services-section]
- `no-order-placement`: The operation must never call a broadcast/write JSON-RPC method (base-layer or Hive-Engine) and must never accept, read, or require a private key. [claims: reads-do-not-place-orders]
- `no-silent-disagreement`: The operation must never average, arbitrarily pick one, or otherwise silently reconcile the two nodes' block-number, tag-payout, or account-mana/vesting readings when they disagree beyond the declared tolerance; it throws instead, naming the disagreeing values in the refusal message. [claims: disagreement-is-refused]
- `no-scot-api-dependency`: The operation must not call `scot-api.hive-engine.com` or assume any of its routes; live probing `2026-09-05` found every plausible pool-config route (`/leo`, `/LEO`, `/leo/pool`, `/pools/leo`, `/leo/config`, `/api/leo`, `/tribes/leo`) 404s and `/@<account>` returns only tokens that account has personally earned, not tribe-level pool state — the on-chain Hive-Engine `tokens` table is the only verified-live source for tribe token supply/stake. [claims: scot-routes-404]
## Laws
- `primitives-exist-once` | 561 Group working discipline | 2026-08-30 | CLAUDE.md | Applies to all decimal arithmetic in this operation. | The BigInt-scaled decimal parse/format/add/multiply primitives live once, in `@red-cup-engineering/computer-ledger-system-services-section`; this operation composes them by exact pin rather than reimplementing any of them.
- `fabricate-do-not-hand-write` | 561 Group working discipline, dispatch-agents skill | 2026-09-04 | .claude/skills/dispatch-agents/SKILL.md | Applies to this whole operation source file. | The operation is born through the jsnode fabrication line from this work order, never hand-written.
- `liquidity-stays-liquid` | Operating constraint | 2026-09-04 | lib/emsenn/services/561-group/services/561-group-services-section/content/text/glossary/terms/fintech-friday.md | Applies to the operation's read-only scope. | This operation is the read-only yield measurement `schedule-set-of-votes` needs before any vote is scheduled; it never stakes, delegates, or locks anything.
- `frictions-are-duties` | 561 Group working discipline | 2026-09-04 | .claude/rules/working-discipline.md | Applies to the one new decimal-division helper this operation adds. | No house decimal-division-strings primitive exists yet; this gap is admitted as a friction against `@red-cup-engineering/computer-ledger-system-services-section` rather than silently grown into a second decimal library.
- `voting-is-not-fenced` | Operating constraint | 2026-09-04 | .claude/rules/working-discipline.md | Applies to why this operation and its siblings exist at all. | The standing fence is no automated POSTING or commenting from the existing Hive accounts; voting was never fenced, so a curation-yield read and the vote schedule/cast it feeds are in scope.
## Standards
- `node-esm-operation` | Node.js | v24.2.0+ | https://nodejs.org/docs/v24/api/esm.html | Applies to the .mjs operation and its import.meta.main guard. | The package uses one executable ESM operation source file eligible for downstream staged package-birth assays.
- `hive-condenser-and-bridge-api` | Hive blockchain developer portal | 2026 revision | https://developers.hive.io/apidefinitions/ | Applies to every `condenser_api`/`bridge` JSON-RPC method this operation calls. | The operation calls exactly the read methods this reference names (`get_dynamic_global_properties`, `get_accounts`, `bridge.get_ranked_posts`) with the parameter shapes it documents; `bridge.get_ranked_posts` and the accounts' `voting_manabar`/`vesting_shares` fields were confirmed live 2026-09-05 against `api.hive.blog`.
- `hive-engine-rpc-contracts` | Hive-Engine / Steem Smart Contracts | public RPC | https://api.hive-engine.com/rpc/contracts | Applies to the `find` call against the `tokens` contract's `tokens` table. | The operation calls exactly the JSON-RPC 2.0 `find` method this public sidechain node exposes, confirmed live 2026-09-05 for symbols LEO/POB/CENT/WAIV.
- `hive-voting-manabar-model` | Hive blockchain developer portal (condenser `get_accounts` `voting_manabar`) | 2026 revision | https://developers.hive.io/apidefinitions/ | Applies to the mana projection. | Voting mana regenerates linearly from `current_mana` at `last_update_time` to `maxMana` (effective vesting shares) over {{regeneration-seconds}} seconds (5 days), capped at `maxMana`; confirmed live 2026-09-05 that `effective_vesting_shares` in raw units equals the account's own `voting_manabar` scale.
## Open questions
- `single-hive-engine-witness` [nonblocking]: Only one public Hive-Engine node is cross-checked (no second public HE RPC node's agreement was verified live as of 2026-09-05); a second-node cross-check for the Hive-Engine read is left to a follow-on task.
