# run-hive-curation-cycle
## Requirements
- `takes-founder-policy-as-data`: The operation takes `request.policy` (a plain `HiveCurationPolicyRecord` object, never a file path — file I/O stays in the CLI entry point, never inside the pure operation) naming `accounts`, `tags`, `nodes`, `hiveEngineNode`, `postsPerTag`, the vote policy fields (`dailyManaBudgetPercent`,`minWeight`,`maxWeight`,`dustPendingPayoutThresholdHbd`,`dustWeight`,`preferredTags`,`neverVoteAuthors`,`curationWindowSeconds`,`curationWindowToleranceSeconds`,`maxDailyBudgetPercent`), `postingKeyPathTemplate` (containing the literal substring `{account}`), and `journalRoot`.
- `observes-then-schedules-then-casts`: For the policy's accounts and tags, the operation composes, in order and by exact pin, `@red-cup-engineering/observe-tribe-curation-yield-service`'s `observeTribeCurationYield`, then `@red-cup-engineering/schedule-set-of-votes-service`'s `scheduleSetOfVotes` per account, then `@red-cup-engineering/cast-set-of-votes-service`'s `castSetOfVotes` per account — never a fourth reimplementation of any of the three.
- `gathers-candidate-posts`: For each policy tag, the operation reads `bridge.get_ranked_posts` (sort `created`, limit `request.postsPerTag`) from the policy's primary node and maps each post to `{tag,symbol,author,permlink,ageSeconds,pendingPayoutValueHbd,netRshares}` for `scheduleSetOfVotes`'s `candidatePosts`.
- `resolves-key-path-per-account`: The operation resolves each account's posting-key path by substituting the literal account name for `{account}` in `policy.postingKeyPathTemplate`, never printing or returning the resolved path's file contents.
- `returns-and-implicitly-journals`: The operation returns a `HiveCurationCycleRunRecord` `{type,version,runAt,yieldReadout,accounts:{[account]:{schedule,cast}}}`; the per-vote journal entries are written by the composed `castSetOfVotes` call, never duplicated here.
- `supports-deterministic-replay`: The operation accepts optional `request.fetchImpl` and `request.castVote` (forwarded into the composed calls) and `request.now`, so a fully-injected request never touches the network or a real key file.
- `holds-accounts-pending-founder-policy`: For each of `policy.heldAccounts` (default `[]`), the operation never calls `scheduleSetOfVotes` or `castSetOfVotes` for that account; it journals one `{account,held:true,reason}` record (category `cycle-account-result`) through `@red-cup-engineering/semantic-record-journal-service` and returns `accounts[account] = {held:true, schedule:null, cast:null}`. Every non-held account also gets one `{account,held:false,scheduledCount,castCount,refusalReason}` journal record in the same category, so one cycle always produces exactly one journal line per policy account naming its held/run outcome.
## Prohibitions
- `no-second-observe-schedule-cast`: The operation must not reimplement any behavior of `observeTribeCurationYield`, `scheduleSetOfVotes`, or `castSetOfVotes`; it only composes them. [claims: the-three-are-composed]
- `no-policy-file-read-in-operation`: The operation (including its CLI entry point) must never open the policy file itself (no `readFileText`, no `node:fs`); reading the founder's policy file from disk and composing it into the one JSON request line is the deploying timer's job (a shell `cat`/`jq` step in its `ExecStart`), never this package's, so every call to this operation stays a pure, example-testable transformation of its input object. [claims: the-policy-arrives-as-data]
- `no-signing-or-key-read`: The operation must never read a posting-key file itself or construct a signer; that stays inside the composed `castSetOfVotes` call. [claims: the-signer-is-inside-cast]
- `no-post-comment-follow-reblog-transfer`: The operation must never call any Hive write operation beyond what `castSetOfVotes` already casts (`vote` only). [claims: cast-votes-only]
## Laws
- `fabricate-do-not-hand-write` | 561 Group working discipline, dispatch-agents skill | 2026-09-04 | .claude/skills/dispatch-agents/SKILL.md | Applies to this whole operation source file. | The operation is born through the jsnode fabrication line from this work order, never hand-written.
- `no-automated-posting-fence` | Founder standing fence | 2026-09-04 | .claude/rules/working-discipline.md | Applies to the entire scope of this operation. | No automated posting or commenting from the founder's existing Hive accounts, ever; voting was never fenced, so this cycle observes, schedules, and casts votes only.
- `vote-budget-capped-until-policy-says-otherwise` | Operating constraint | 2026-09-05 | curation-services-section/data/state/hive-curation-policy-state/hive-curation-policy.json | Applies to `request.policyPath`'s `maxDailyBudgetPercent` and `maxWeight` defaults. | The vote budget is capped at 20 percent of mana until the policy record changes. The default vote weight is lowered and can be raised through that policy record; the created record encodes both constraints.
## Standards
- `node-esm-operation` | Node.js | v24.2.0+ | https://nodejs.org/docs/v24/api/esm.html | Applies to the .mjs operation and its import.meta.main guard. | The package uses one executable ESM operation source file eligible for downstream staged package-birth assays.
- `hive-bridge-get-ranked-posts` | Hive blockchain developer portal (bridge API) | 2026 revision | https://developers.hive.io/apidefinitions/ | Applies to the `gathers-candidate-posts` requirement. | The operation calls exactly `bridge.get_ranked_posts` with the parameter shape this reference documents, the same call `observe-tribe-curation-yield-service` already makes per tag.
## Open questions
- `duplicate-post-fetch` [nonblocking]: This operation makes its own `bridge.get_ranked_posts` read per tag rather than receiving posts from `observeTribeCurationYield` (which does not yet return individual posts, only aggregates); a follow-on additive version of `observe-tribe-curation-yield-service` that also returns each tag's posts would let this operation drop its own duplicate read.
